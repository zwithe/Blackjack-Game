This is my first full project from scratch! The hardest part was practicing D.R.Y. things like copy paste, functions, control shift l, and multi cursor make repition so easy. I wanted to do so much more!
I wanted a split fuction! I wanted a little leaderboard of the local high score (longest lasted with 2500$). I wanted a see optimal play function that would show you what you would do following basic strategy. I might come back and work on these later. I have a bunch of functions that all they do is call other fuctions. I'm not sure if that's the best way of doing things. It kinda just worked out with the way I wrote certian things needed multiple functions to be called. Ids are mostly used over classes beacause javascript needs to target those items seprately even if the styling is similar.
